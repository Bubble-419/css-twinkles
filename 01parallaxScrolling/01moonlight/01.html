      <h5>The Crescent Moon</h5>
      <p>Slipping softly through the sky
        Little horned, happy moon,
        Can you hear me up so high?
        Will you come down soon?
        <br>
        On my nursery window-sill
        Will you stay your steady flight?
        And then float away with me
        Through the summer night?
        <br>
        Brushing over tops of trees,
        Playing hide and seek with stars,
        Peeping up through shiny clouds
        At Jupiter or Mars.
        <br>

        I shall fill my lap with roses
        Gathered in the milky way,
        All to carry home to mother.
        Oh! what will she say!
        <br>

        Little rocking, sailing moon,
        Do you hear me shout â€” Ahoy!
        Just a little nearer, moon,
        To please a little boy.</p>
